# [AdsClown 0.0.1](https://github.com/bencten/adsclown)
### What is this?

**Welcome to AdsClown! ** 

*Trust me, I love my credit union, but I hate their ads, and other stupid crap that they push on me. This quick little extension gets rid of my most hated ads and replaces them with ... nothing!And nothing is good.*

### What is replaced?
- # [MOGL](https://www.mogl.com/)
- SDCCU Dining Deals

[Getting started](https://github.com/bencten/adsclown/wiki)  


### What's in the future? 
A bevy of upgrades:
- Prettier, who doesn't like prettier
- Toggle on/off of this extension
- Lazy event loading of background.js
- Ads bust count
- Interstitial kill of a redirect of more ads!


### Fork ME
It took a few tutorials to get this far, might as well use this as springboard for a your first browser action extension.
